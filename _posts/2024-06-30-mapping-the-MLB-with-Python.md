## Introduction

Welcome to Explorations in Geospatial Analysis (aka Mitchy Maps). I've been exploring the world of GIS and geospatial analytics in my work. It's been slow going so far, but every time I make progress I'm excited and more energized to learn about this space. I created this blog as a way to learn and share my progress.

The world of data science is generally opaque for people who aren't data scientists. Geospatial data science is even more opaque. This will broadly be an attempt to help data curious people like me understand how to use common tool, techniques, and libraries to perform geospatial analysis for business & pleasure. Thanks for following along!

## Project Overview

People who know me well know that I love baseball (go Braves!). As a sort of ceremonial first pitch for this blog, I decided to map MLB stadiums and analyze team attendance (and performance) relative to various geospatial factors, such as population density, proximity to other teams, traffic patterns, and more.

I performed all of my analysis in Python for this project. The libraries I used are: 

- BeautifulSoup for scraping MLB ballpark addresses & Nominatim for geocoding them
- pygris for gathering census data from the US Census API
- geopandas for working with geospatial data
- folium for mapping

I also used Mapbox GL JS to create the interactive maps below.

The data sources I'm using are: 

- X
- Y
- Z
