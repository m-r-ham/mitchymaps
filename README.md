Geospatial analysis, mapping, etc. (learning &amp; sharing)

This project is a collection of mapping & geospatial analytics projects on random topics that I'm interested in. I'm doing a lot of this type of work in my professional life and have found it personally interesting and stimulating as well. 

Most of this work will be done in Python. Some will be done in ArcGIS Pro, some in Mapbox. I will also try to explore using R for some mapping as well. I'll use pygris and cenpy, geopy, geopandas, gdal, arcpy, and several other libraries for this analysis as I explore spatial relationships and geospatial data. 

Thanks for following along!
